            <h2>The Prisoner's Dilemma</h2>
            <p>
                Imagine that there are two prisoners both convicted for a joint crime. The prosecutor has insufficient evidence to build a case against either of the prisoners, and so offers each of them a deal. The prisoners are being held in separate rooms and so can’t communicate.                
            </p>
            <p>
                The prosecutor tells each prisoner that if they confess to the crime, providing enough evidence to convict the other prisoner, then they will walk free but leaving their fellow convict to 10 years in prison. However, if both the prisoners choose to confess then they will both have to serve 7 years in prison. If they instead both remain silent, they will be forced to serve a year before they are released.                
            </p>
            <p>
                Now lets define ‘rational’ as acting in a way that will result in the shortest sentence in jail. By this definition the rational decision in this situation is always to confess. This is because if the other prisoner remains silent then the optimum strategy is to confess and walk free, the other case is that the other prisoner confesses and again in this case the best strategy is to confess and serve 7 years.                
            </p>
            <p>
                If both prisoners act rationally and choose to confess then they will end up with a significantly worse outcome than if they cooperated and both remained silent. This is the prisoner’s dilemma.
            </p>
            <p>
                The prisoner’s dilemma is a standard example of a game in that shows why rational individuals may not cooperate. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To introduce the notion of a 'payoff matrix', this is the payoff matrix for the prisoners dilemma
            </p>

            <h2>Evolutionary Game Theory</h2>
            <p>Evolutionary game theory applies classical game theory to evolution. It is funda-
                mentally different from classical game theory in the respect that, instead of consid-
                ering contests between rational decision makers, we suppose that each member of a
                population assumes a behaviour strategy, then the success of a certain strategy will
                depend on contests between members of the population.</p>
            <p>Lets define a behaviour strategy as an individual having a predisposition to act in a certain way.
                It is important to consider the individual as not being consciously aware of the
                strategy they have adopted, then this provides a way of modelling evolution at the
                “phenotypic level”. A contest is an interaction
                between two individuals within the population that provokes them to act in a manner
                that is dictated by an individuals behavioural phenotype, which we will refer to as
                an individuals strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can expand the example of the Prisoner’s dilemma into the framework of evolutionary
                game theory we have outline. In this context the Prisoner’s dilemma provides an interesting
                metaphor for cooperation in a population. Now instead of having two rational
                players in a contest, we define there to be a population where individuals can belong
                to 2 opposing strategies. The first strategy, C, is defined as individuals who will
                either cooperate and remain silent. The second strategy, D, which we will define as
                individuals who will defect and confess their crime.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then we can create a payoff matrix of the same structure to the one we saw before in Prisoner’s Dilemma example:
            </p>
            <div class="figure">
                <img src="images/cooperators.png" alt="Prisoners Dilemma Payoff Matrix" style="width: 20%;"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                Now if we let x equal to the proportion of Cooperators in the population, then it follows that the number of Defectors is 1-x. Then we can calculate the fitness of a strategy N, by calculating the sum of the proportion of individuals that have adopted strategy N multiplied by the payoff of strategy N and the proportion of individuals who have adopted an opposing strategy multiplied by the payoff of that opposing strategy. Applying this to the payoff matrix we find the following equations:
            </p>
            <div class="figure">
                <img src="images/payoff.png" alt="Prisoners Dilemma Payoff Matrix" style="width: 50%;"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                Since X will always be greater than or equal to 0 since it is a proportion, these equations show that the fitness of defecting is always greater than the fitness of cooperating. So under the mechanism of natural selection we should expect to see the population converging to a state where all individuals are defectors.
            </p>
            <p>
                This contradicts what we observe in biology where cooperation is abundant, so we
                find ourselves with the problem of how could altruism have evolved through natural
                selection when the behaviour strategy of cooperation is so exposed to being exploited
                by defectors.
            </p>
            <a name="cellularAutomata"></a>
            <h2>Cellular Automata</h2>
            <p>
                A cellular automaton is an n-dimensional array containing individual cells that
                an take a finite number of discrete values. There are a given set of rules dictating
                what value a cell will take after a discrete time period. These rules are dependent
                only on a cell’s immediate neighbours.
            </p>
            <p>
                How we wish to define a cell's immediate neighbours is up to us. Two commonly used definitions for a cells neighbourhood is Von 
                nuemann neighbourhood and a Moore's neighbourhood
            </p>
            <p>
                To define these two neighbourhoods lets uppose we have a 2 dimensional cellular automata that all have some x coordinate and some y coordinate such that x,y are both real numbers. Then the von nuemann neighbourhood is all values of i and j such that i and j are real numbers and:
            </p>
            <div class="figure">
                <img src="images/nuemann.png" alt="Von Nuemann Conditions" style="width: 50%;"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                The Moore neighbourhood is all values of i and j such that i and j are real numbers and:
            </p>
            <div class="figure">
                <img src="images/moore.png" alt="Moore neighbourhood conditions" style="width: 50%;" />
            </div>
            <p>
                We want to consider only the case when R = 1. These two diagrams depict clearly how the two neighbourhoods differ:
            </p>
            <div class="figure">
                <img src="images/grids.png" alt="Cellular Automata neighbourhood grids"  style="width: 70%"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                There are three 3 different boundary conditions I want to introduce, fixed, reflective and periodic. The first and most simple case is a fixed boundary condition, this means that at the boundary all cells will take a fixed value. This can be depicted using a one dimensional cellular automata: 
            </p>
            <div class="figure">
                <img src="images/fixed.png" alt="Cellular Automata neighbourhood grids"  style="width: 50%"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                A second way of handling the boundary condition is to use a reflective boundary
                condition, in this case the lattice is reflected at the boundary. The below diagram demonstrates reflective boundary conditions on a one dimensional cellular automata.
            </p>
            <div class="figure">
                <img src="images/reflective.png" alt="Cellular Automata neighbourhood grids"  style="width: 50%"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                The third way we will consider is a periodic boundary condition. Extending a 2D
                ellular automaton with periodic boundary conditions will result in a torus shape
                eing produced. The image below demonstrates how periodic boundary conditions work
                in a one dimensional cellular automaton.

            <h2>
                Evolutionary Spatial Games
            </h2>
            <p>
                In evolutionary game theory there is an assumption that every individual has an equal chance of interacting with each other. When Robert May and Martin Nowak introduced the idea of evolutionary spatial games, they argued that assumption is an abstraction. In fact, it is more likely that an individual will interact with other individuals within their immediate neighbourhood. Using a cellular automata based model gives us a capacity to model this, giving us a spatial element to our evolutionary games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Firstly, we define a round to be an iteration of the spatial game, and we define a game as a contest between two individuals within the population. Then we can outline the idea of a evolutionary spatial game, let all the individuals in a population be placed on a 2 dimensional spatial array, then each round every cell within the population will play a game with every individual in it’s immediate neighbourhood. The update rule is that each cell will be occupied by the strategy that had the highest payoff within the cell’s immediate neighbourhood, including itself. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For an example lets considered a generalised payoff matrix of two strategies, A which will be represented by the colour blue and B which will be represented by the colour red.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then we have the following payoff matrix:
            </p>
            <div class="figure">
                <img src="images/general.png" alt="Cellular Automata neighbourhood grids"  style="width: 25%"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                We must use 25 different cells to calculate the payoff for a single cell, the focal cell will then be updated to the strategy that 
                had the highest payoff in it's immediate neighbourhood, this will depend on the values for a,b,c and d. Here is an example of how all the payoff values are calculated:
            </p>
            <div class="figure">
                <img src="images/exampleGame.png" alt="Cellular Automata neighbourhood grids"  style="width: 55%"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                We can then set the matrix to be a simplified version of the prisoner's dilemma:
            </p>
            <div class="figure">
                <img src="images/prisonersMatrix.png" alt="Cellular Automata neighbourhood grids"  style="width: 30%"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                For simplicity we will choose to set epsilon to be equal to zero, then by varying the value of b we can find some interesting results. Starting from a population of 90% cooperators, we find that when b changes from 1.15 to 1.7 we get the following results:
            </p>
            <div class="figure">
                <img src="images/lowb.png" alt="Cellular Automata neighbourhood grids"  style="width: 80%"/>
            </div>
            <div class="figure">
                <img src="images/medB.png" alt="Cellular Automata neighbourhood grids"  style="width: 79%"/>
            </div>
            <div class="figure">
                <img src="images/highb.png" alt="Cellular Automata neighbourhood grids"  style="width: 80%"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                In also of these examples we can see both strategies mutually coexisting.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can also consider games where we have one defector invading an entire population of cooperators. By setting b = 1.65 
                and neighbourhood condition to a Moore neighbourhood we find the following fractal pattern emerging.
