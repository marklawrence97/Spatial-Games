            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>This page is intended to provide an introduction into Evolutionary Spatial Games. There are some necessary prerequisites that I will go over first. The goal is to be able to replicate some of the interesting patterns discovered by Martin Nowak and Robert May, in the Evolutionary Spatial Games GUI that can be found <a href="https://github.com/marklawrence97/Evolutionary-Spatial-Games" target="blank">here</a>.<p>

            <h2>The Prisoner's Dilemma</h2>
            <p>
                Imagine that there are two prisoners both convicted for a joint crime. The prosecutor has insufficient evidence to build a case against either of the prisoners, and so offers each of them a deal. The prisoners are being held in separate rooms and so can’t communicate.                
            </p>
            <p>
                The prosecutor tells each prisoner that if they confess to the crime, providing enough evidence to convict the other prisoner, then they will walk free but leaving their fellow convict to 10 years in prison. However, if both the prisoners choose to confess then they will both have to serve 7 years in prison. If they instead both remain silent, they will be forced to serve a year before they are released.                
            </p>
            <p>
                Now lets define ‘rational’ as acting in a way that will result in the shortest sentence in jail. By this definition the rational decision in this situation is always to confess. This is because if the other prisoner remains silent then the optimum strategy is to confess and walk free, the other case is that the other prisoner confesses and again in this case the best strategy is to confess and serve 7 years.                
            </p>
            <p>
                If both prisoners act rationally and choose to confess then they will end up with a significantly worse outcome than if they cooperated and both remained silent. This is the prisoner’s dilemma.
            </p>
            <p>
                The prisoner’s dilemma is a standard example of a game in that shows why rational individuals may not cooperate. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To introduce the notion of a 'payoff matrix', this is the payoff matrix for the prisoners dilemma

            <h2>Evolutionary Game Theory</h2>
            <p>Evolutionary game theory applies classical game theory to evolution. It is funda-
                mentally different from classical game theory in the respect that, instead of consid-
                ering contests between rational decision makers, we suppose that each member of a
                population assumes a behaviour strategy, then the success of a certain strategy will
                depend on contests between members of the population.</p>
            <p>Lets define a behaviour strategy as an individual having a predisposition to act in a certain way.
                It is important to consider the individual as not being consciously aware of the
                strategy they have adopted, then this provides a way of modelling evolution at the
                “phenotypic level”. A contest is an interaction
                between two individuals within the population that provokes them to act in a manner
                that is dictated by an individuals behavioural phenotype, which we will refer to as
                an individuals strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can expand the example of the Prisoner’s dilemma into the framework of evolutionary
                game theory we have outline. In this context the Prisoner’s dilemma provides an interesting
                metaphor for cooperation in a population. Now instead of having two rational
                players in a contest, we define there to be a population where individuals can belong
                to 2 opposing strategies. The first strategy, C, is defined as individuals who will
                either cooperate and remain silent. The second strategy, D, which we will define as
                individuals who will defect and confess their crime.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then we can create a payoff matrix of the same structure to the one we saw before in Prisoner’s Dilemma example:
            </p>
            <div class="figure">
                <img src="images/cooperators.png" alt="Prisoners Dilemma Payoff Matrix" style="width: 20%;"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                Now if we let x equal to the proportion of Cooperators in the population, then it follows that the number of Defectors is 1-x. Then we can calculate the fitness of N strategies , by calculating the sum of the proportion of individuals that have adopted strategy N multiplied by the payoff of strategy N. Applying this to the payoff matrix we find the following equations:
            </p>
            <div class="figure">
                <img src="images/payoff.png" alt="Prisoners Dilemma Payoff Matrix" style="width: 50%;"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                Since X will always be greater than or equal to 0 since it is a proportion, these equations show that the fitness of defecting is always greater than the fitness of cooperating. So under the mechanism of natural selection we should expect to see the population converging to a state where all individuals are defectors.
            </p>
            <p>
                This contradicts what we observe in biology where cooperation is abundant, so we
                find ourselves with the problem of how could altruism have evolved through natural
                selection when the behaviour strategy of cooperation is so exposed to being exploited
                by defectors.

            <h2>Cellular Automata</h2>
            <p>
                A cellular automaton is an n-dimensional array containing individual cells that
                an take a finite number of discrete values. There are a given set of rules dictating
                what value a cell will take after a discrete time period. These rules are dependent
                only on a cell’s immediate neighbours.
            </p>
            <p>
                How we wish to define a cell's immediate neighbours is up to us. Two commonly used definitions for a cells neighbourhood is Von 
                nuemann neighbourhood and a Moore's neighbourhood
